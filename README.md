# Flood-Forecasting-in-Sudan
Throughout history, floods had impacted both individuals and communities and had social, economic, and environmental consequences including loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases. Unprecedented floods occurred in Sudan from July–September 2020, reaching water levels not seen for nearly a century in the country. Close to 900,000 people were affected in all 18 states. The floods destroyed over 100,000 houses and damaged more than 37,000 houses nationwide [1]. There is an urgent need for systems that predict floods to help the concerned authorities take the necessary measures before a disaster occurs. The surge in the frequency of rainfalls most potentially enhances the rate of flooding thus, the focus of this research will be on studying the rainfall data in Sudan and study multiple regression-based techniques in determining the rainfall future rate.
